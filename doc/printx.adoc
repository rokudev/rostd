= Leveraging pass:[C++20] For A True Type-Safe `printf`

== Introduction

_"Yet another type-safe printf? Isn't that a solved problem?"_

Many pass:[C++] formatting libraries claim to be a "type-safe printf" but
they are in reality alternatives to or replacements for `printf`.
`rostd::printf` is not one of those; it is _literally_ type-safe `printf`.

== The Problem of `printf`

Standard C `printf` (and, by extension, pass:[C++] `std::printf`) is not
_portably type-safe_.

. It does not guarantee that the parameters given to the function match the
  specifiers in the format string. This is not only a source of bugs, it's also
  dangerous from a security perspective. Modern compilers typically implement
  extensions that will identify `printf`-like calls and can provide warnings at
  compile time when the specifiers don't match the arguments.
. It is blind to typedefs. A typedef that is a `long int` might be a
  `long long int` when compiled for a different platform. The only way to make
  a typedef portable with `printf` is to give it its own format specifier. Some
  types have special standard format modifiers, such as `std::size_t` (`%zu`).
  But the vast majority of types are relegated to using macros, as with types
  like `uint64_t` (`PRIu64`) and all user-defined types.
. Some types don't even have a standard portable definition or associated
  format specifier.
  An example of this is the various `std::chrono::duration` types,
  each of which has an underlying representation defined merely as
  "signed integer type of at least [N] bits."
  You cannot print `duration.count()` using (for example) `PRId64` or `%jd`
  and remain strictly portable.

Special emphasis on the last sentence of point #2: if you want your own
types to be _portably type-safe_ for use with `printf`, you must
associate each of those types with their own custom format specifier.
For example:

[source,cpp]
----
using Identifier = std::uint64_t;
#define PRI_Identifier PRIu64
----

Then, the custom format specifier must be used everywhere as such:

[source,cpp]
----
printf("The identifier is %" PRI_Identifier ".\n", id);
----

This is awkward and cumbersome, difficult to read, and requires
strict devotion and attention to detail. I have never seen
it work out in practice.

== Alternatives

As already mentioned, there are many alternatives to `printf` available, from
standard iostreams to `std::format` to many different open-source libraries.
We at Roku have investigated many of those options over the years. However,
Roku code has a strong history with `printf` and we did not want that to
change, for several reasons:

* Many (almost all) type-safe formatting alternatives cause the compiler to
  generate more code either at the call point and/or as part of an
  implementation library. At Roku we are naturally averse to these code size
  increases.
* Given how much code needed to change, we were not comfortable adopting a
  strategy that would revolutionize how we do formatting (as iostreams would,
  for instance). It is too much work to transition and difficult for
  developers to adapt to it.
* We could not afford to sacrifice runtime performance across the board. Even
  a formatting library that is faster most of the time, but doesn't match or
  exceed current performance in all cases, is a risk.
* There were other internal considerations related to how we do certain things
  (such as logging) that would make a transition away from `printf` formatting
  difficult and risky.

== A Real Solution

What if we could do this:

[source,cpp]
----
printf("The identifier is %?.\n", id);
----

and just print whatever is there.
We know the compiler can do error checking (with GCC, it is accomplished via
the `format` attribute extension). The compiler should be able to go the
rest of the way and fix up the string for us, replacing the `%?` specifier
with `%llu` or whatever the type demands.

If that were possible:

* The caller would not need to care about what the type of `id` might be.
* If the type changes, all format strings that print this type will
  automatically adjust, safely.

Fortunately, we at Roku had already enabled pass:[C++20]. It has lots of
powerful features, but one in particular lets us do exactly this:

[source,cpp]
----
printf<"The identifier is %?.\n">(id);
----

Here we take advantage of a feature in pass:[C++20] called cNTTP
(class Non Type Template Parameter). An _instance_ of a string literal
class type can be a template parameter, and with it, you can do almost
anything you want _at compile time_.

== Enter `rostd::printf`

The `rostd` (pronounced "roasted") library is Roku's internal extensions to
the pass:[C++] standard library. The `rostd::printf` family of functions is
part of that library, and `rostd::printf` looks like this:

[source,cpp]
----
namespace rostd {
    template <printx::FmtLiteral Fmt, typename... Args>
    int printf(Args const&... args) noexcept {
        auto call = [&](auto const&... args) {
            static constexpr auto f = printx::build_fmt<Fmt, Args...>();
            return std::printf(f.data, args...);
        };
        return printx::call_func(call, args...);
    }
} // namespace rostd
----

First note that this formula can be adapted to any `printf`-family function.
In this case, it's a simple wrapper around `std::printf` but it will work for
any such function, and implementations of both `rostd::fprintf` and
`rostd::snprintf` are provided as well.

There are two function calls in here, both within the `rostd::printx`
namespace, which do nearly all of the work:

`rostd::printx::build_fmt()`::

This function builds a valid `std::printf` format string based on an analysis
of the format string `Fmt` (template parameter) coupled with the types
provided in `Args`. Its job is:

* Look for instances of `%?` and replace them with the correct specifiers for
  the associated argument types in `Args`.
* Find other (standard) specifiers, verify that they are compatible with
  the associated type, generating a compile-time error if they are not.
* Build a new format string containing all the correct specifier replacements,
  null-terminate and return it.

`rostd::printx::call_func()`::

This function applies the provided arguments to the function, while also
allowing those arguments to be _translated_ to other types. It can therefore
provide direct support for types such as:

* `std::string`, `std::string_view`, `std::filesystem::path`, etc.
* `enum` (and `enum class`) types
* limited support for user-defined types (by specializing the
  `printx::FmtTraits` template class)

Take a look at the source code for more detail. Note that, besides cNTTP,
other new language features used include:
concepts, `consteval`, and `constexpr virtual`.

[NOTE]
====
_Why does the format string need to be a template parameter?_

The string that ends up in the compiled binary is _transformed_ from the one
that is provided in the code. In order to store that transformed string, we
need to know how long it will be, so that we may convert that length to
(part of) a type, like a `std::array`, which will contain the transformed
string. Unfortunately, that's not possible to do in pass:[C++] with a mere
function parameter, because it is not a constant expression.

If we only needed to parse the string to verify its correctness then we
could do that. But building a type from its size does not work. It does
work for template parameters, because they are constant expressions.

== Usage Examples

Here is an example with adjacent functionally-equivalent uses of
`std::printf` and `rostd::printf`, with their resulting object code
disassemblies below them (clang-13, x86_64). Note any differences in the
object code, if you can find them.

[NOTE]
====
The symbol name of the `rostd::printf`-generated format string
(`_ZZZN5rostd6printf`) is much longer than what is presented here,
so it is truncated for display purposes. It's irrelevant for
code-generation comparisons because it does not end up in the final
link of the binary.

----
|===

The result compiles directly to a call of the underlying
`std::printf` function, with a guaranteed-correct format string. It's
impossible to tell (beyond the ephemeral symbol name) that
`rostd::printf` was even used. It compiles away entirely.
This is why `rostd::printf` _is_ type-safe `printf`. The resulting object
code is `printf` _and only_ `printf`!

More usage examples are below. Note the following:

* All standard `printf` format strings are supported; flags, as well as width
  and precision fields, are supported even in combination with `%?`.
* There are no format _length modifiers_ used in these examples.
  You may use them, but they will be ignored and replaced.
* When using `%?`, floating point types are printed as-if using `%g`. However,
  any floating point specifier may be used explicitly.
* Types like `std::string` and `std::string_view` can be printed using
  `%?` or `%s`.

[source,cpp]
----
auto const my_sv = std::string_view{"my string view"};
auto const my_str = std::string{"my string"};
rostd::printf<"%s">(my_sv); // prints "my string view"
rostd::printf<"%s">(my_str); // prints "my string"

auto const my_ull = 12345ull;
rostd::printf<"%u">(my_ull); // prints "12345"
rostd::printf<"%?">(my_ull); // prints "12345"
rostd::printf<"0x%x">(my_ull); // prints "0x3039"
rostd::printf<"%o">(my_ull); // prints "30071"
rostd::printf<"%c">(my_ull); // compile-time error: "format %c expects argument of type char"

auto const my_float = 3.125f;
rostd::printf<"%?">(my_float); // prints "3.125"
rostd::printf<"%A">(my_float); // prints "0X1.9P+1"
rostd::printf<"%e">(my_float); // prints "3.125000e+00"

rostd::printf<"%10?">("right"); // prints "     right"
rostd::printf<"%-10?">("left"); // prints "left      "
rostd::printf<"%10.2?">(my_str); // prints "        my"
rostd::printf<"%-10.2?">(my_str); // prints "my        "
----

== Error Messages

Strict error checking is performed on the format strings that are given to
`rostd::printf`. However, because pass:[C++] does not provide a way to
directly customize the compiler's error messages, `rostd::printf` will
cause the compiler to trigger an error on a line of code that begins with
`PRINTX_ERROR` when there is a problem. If such an error occurs, whatever
else is printed, there should be some text in the error message that looks
something like:

----
rostd-public/rostd/include/rostd/printx.hpp:204:13: note: in expansion of macro ‘PRINTX_ERROR’
  204 |             PRINTX_ERROR("format %c expects argument of type char");
      |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~
----

The rest of the error message should then give you enough information to
trace the problem back to the line of code that caused it.

== Compiler Performance

Given that we're now running more code at compile time, it is important
to be aware of how it affects compile time performance. The graph below
demonstrates the compile performance (using gcc-10.3) for a `rostd::printf`
statement with N:[1-64] parameters.

* The yellow line (printf-int) is the _baseline_. It is the time to compile
  a file with one `std::printf` statement that contains N parameters
  (all `int`, in this case).
* The blue line (printx-int) represents the same, but using `rostd::printf`
  instead of `std::printf`.
* The orange line (printx-double) represents `rostd::printf` with N parameters
  that are of type `double`.
* The gray line (printx-string_view) represents `rostd::printf` with N
  parameters that are of type `std::string_view`. This diverges significantly
  because for each `std::string_view` parameter, two values go on the stack
  (to be passed to `std::printf`).

image::./printx.jpg[]

Since most `printf` calls contain at most a handful of parameters, compile
times are not significantly affected. But even in the rare case of a printf
with dozens of parameters, compile times can still remain reasonable.
Additionally, we believe compilers will get better at this over time.

== Adapting "Printx Form" To Your Own Functions

Take the following hypothetical example:

[source,cpp]
----
class Logger {
public:
    int log(char const* fmt, ...) __attribute__((format(printf, 2, 3)));
};
----

You can adapt this to `printx` form by changing it to use the formula
described above:

[source,cpp]
----
class Logger {
private:
    int log(char const* fmt, ...);

public:
    template <rostd::printx::FmtLiteral Fmt, typename... Args>
    int log(Args const&... args) {
        auto call = [this](auto const&... args) {
            static constexpr auto f = rostd::printx::build_fmt<Fmt, Args...>();
            return log(f.data, args...);
        };
        return rostd::printx::call_func(call, args...);
    }
};
----

Fixing up all the call points to move the format string into the template
parameter can be done by a script written in your favorite text processing
language.
As already demonstrated, the generated binary object code will be equivalent.
